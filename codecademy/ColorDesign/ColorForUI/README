    The keys to designing for UI:
    
    - Select a dominant brand color and supporting accent colors
    - Use contrast to define sections and differentiate actions
    - Use semantic colors for [error](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/error) and success messages
    - Incorporate default colors for text and backgrounds where needed
    - Neutral colors can provide good contrast
    - Keep users in mind when selecting color
