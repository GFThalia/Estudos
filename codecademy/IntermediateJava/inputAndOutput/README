## Review

### Class - Definition:
System.out	- A class that holds functions to display out in a terminal or command prompt application.
Scanner	- A class used to read input passed into a Java program.
FileWriter - A class that holds functions to convert byte data into readable text files.
FileReader - A class that has functions that convert input from files to byte data for a Java program to use.

### Scanner
Variable	        -              Code
- String	        - String myString = input.next();
- Int	            - int num = input.nextInt();
- Double	        - double numDouble = input.nextDouble();
- Byte	            - byte numByte = input.nextByte();
- Boolean	        - boolean isTrue = input.nextBoolean();
- Long	            - long numLong = input.nextLong();
- Short	            - short numShort = input.nextShort();


 ## Conclusion
- Printing output in a Java program can be done using the following three commands: System.out.print(), System.out.println(), and System.out.printf()
- The Scanner class is built into Java and is useful for reading input from different sources including user input, and text files.
- FileWriter is used to output data from a program into a file on your computer, and FileReader is used to read from a file. They both are specifically tailored to reading and writing character/text data to files.
- IOExceptions are exceptions related to input or output that a program may encounter. They can be handled by a programmer using try-catch blocks.
- Java programs must initially be compiled into Java byte code before they can be run using a terminal or command prompt. When running a Java program, a user can pass in multiple arguments through the command line.
