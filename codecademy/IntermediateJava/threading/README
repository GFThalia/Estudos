### THREADING: LESSON
### Review
 So far, you have:

- created threads in three different ways:
- extending the Thread class
- implementing the Runnable class
- using the in-line, lambda expression syntax
- started threads with .start()
- paused the execution of threads using Thread.sleep(long millis)
- observed thread execution using the supervisor pattern
- blocked on thread completion with .join()
- synchronized access to shared resources from threads with the synchronized keyword
- communicated between threads with .wait() and .notify()
