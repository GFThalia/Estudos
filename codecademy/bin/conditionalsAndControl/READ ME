
	Im learning and praticing about how to use conditionals and control flow statements in Java programs.
	Then, practicing my skills in two projects:
	
	1. CarLoan
		A Simple Car Loan Payment Calculator
	     The program will include the following:
		 Car loan amount
		 Interest rate of the loan
		 Length of the loan (in years)
		 Down payment
		
	2. Continents
		Continents and Cities
		 The program that will print out a continent 
		 and the largest city in that continent, based on 
		 the value of an integer.
	
	
	
	
	
	IMPORTANT:
 
  Specific conditional statements have the following behavior:
	if-then:
	code block runs if condition is true
	if-then-else:
	one block runs if conditions is true
	another block runs if condition is false
	if-then-else chained:
	same as if-then but an arbitrary number of conditions
	switch:
	switch block runs if condition value matches case value


  Conditional-And: &&
	The AND operator, &&, is used between two boolean values and evaluates to a
	single boolean value. If the values on both sides are true, then the resulting
	value is true, otherwise the resulting value is false.
	
  Conditional-Or: ||
	The OR operator, ||, is used between two boolean values and evaluates to a single 
	boolean value. If either of the two values is true, then the resulting value is true, 
	otherwise the resulting value is false.
	
  Logical NOT: !
  	The unary operator NOT, !, works on a single value. This operator evaluates to the 
  	opposite boolean to which itâ€™s applied:
	NOT is useful for expressing our intent clearly in programs. For example, sometimes 
	we need the opposite behavior of an if-then: run a code block only if the condition is false.
	

		Multiple conditional operators, the order of evaluation is as follows: 
		Expressions in parentheses -> NOT -> AND -> OR.
