The this keyword can’t be used by a static method since static methods are associated with 
an entire class, not a specific object of that class. If you try to mix this with a static 
method, you’ll see the error message non-static variable this cannot be referenced from a 
static context.

Here are some of the main takeaways from this lesson:

Static methods and variables are associated with the class as a whole, not objects of the class.

Static methods and variables are declared as static by using the static keyword upon declaration.

Static methods cannot interact with non-static instance variables. This is due to static methods 
not having a this reference.
Remember, static methods have no this reference, and so they can’t access instance variables.

Both static methods and non-static methods can interact with static variables.
