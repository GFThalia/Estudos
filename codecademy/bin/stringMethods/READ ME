length()
In Java, the length() string method returns the length ⁠— total number of characters ⁠— of a String.

Suppose we have a String called str, str.length() would return its length.
		In theory, the length of a String is the same as the Unicode units of the String. For example, 
		escape sequences such as \n count as only one character.
		
		
		concat()
The concat() method concatenates one string to the end of another string. Concatenation is 
the operation of joining two strings together.

Suppose we have a String called str1 and another String called str2, using str1.concat(str2) 
would return str1 with str2 appended to the end of it.
Strings are immutable objects which means that String methods, 
like concat() do not actually change a String object.

equals()
With objects, such as Strings, we can’t use the primitive equality operator == to check for 
equality between two strings. To test equality with strings, we use a built-in method called equals().
Side note, there’s also an equalsIgnoreCase() method that compares two strings without 
considering upper/lower cases.
When we use .compareTo(), we must pay attention to the return value:
If the method returns 0, the two Strings are equal.
If the value is less than 0, then the String object is lexicographically less 
than the String object argument.
If the value is greater than 0, then the String object is lexicographically greater than 
the String object argument.

indexOf()
If we want to know the index of the first occurence of a character in a string, we can use the indexOf() 
method on a string.
The indexOf() instance method can also return where the substring begins (the index of the first 
character in the substring)

charAt()
The charAt() method returns the character located at a String‘s specified index.

substring()
There may be times when we only want a part of a string. In such cases, we may 
want to extract a substring from a string.
The substring begins with the character at the specified index and extends to the end of the string.

toUpperCase() / toLowerCase()
toUpperCase(): returns the string value converted to uppercase
toLowerCase(): returns the string value converted to lowercase
