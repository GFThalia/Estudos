### Review - INSERTING AND UPDATING

 We’ve covered numerous topics regarding creating and updating documents in collections. Let’s recap some key takeaways from this lesson:

- The _id field is a unique identifier for documents in a collection. By default, MongoDB assigns an ObjectId value to the _id field for each document.
- Individual documents can be added to a collection with .insertOne(), and the document to be inserted is provided as an argument.
- Multiple documents can be inserted into a collection with the .insertMany() method. An array containing all the documents to insert is passed in an argument.
- The .updateOne() method is used to update the first document within the collection that matches a given query.
- We can use .updateMany() to update multiple matching documents simultaneously.
- The $push operator appends a specified value to an array.
- The .findAndModify() method modifies and returns a single document in a collection. By default, it returns the original document, and if no matching document is found, a new one can be inserted by adding the upsert option.

In addition to the methods we’ve learned throughout this lesson, MongoDB offers us other syntax and commands that can be useful when inserting, updating, or replacing documents:
- The ordered parameter can be provided to the .insertMany() method. It accepts a boolean value, and, if set to false, will insert the documents in an unordered format to increase performance.
- The $unset operator can be provided to the .updateOne() or .updateMany() method. It removes a particular field from a document.
- The .findOneAndUpdate() method is similar to .updateOne(), but instead of returning a document acknowledging the success or failure of our operation, it returns either the original or updated document.
- The .renameCollection() method allows us to update the name of our collection without modifying any of its documents.
- The .bulkWrite() method allows us to perform multiple write operations (updating or inserting) with controls for order of execution.


### Review - DELETING DOCUMENTS
- Let’s go over a quick summary of what we’ve learned about deleting in MongoDB:
- The .deleteOne() method deletes a single document from a collection. It accepts a filter document specifying which document to delete as the first parameter.
- The .deleteOne() method will only delete the first matching document in the collection.
- The .deleteMany() method deletes all matching documents from a collection. It accepts a filter document specifying which document to delete as the first parameter.
- The .replaceOne() method replaces an entire document from a collection. It takes in filtering criteria specifying the document to replace as the first parameter and a replacement document as the second one.
- The .replaceOne() method will only replace the first matching document in the collection.
- Since .replaceOne() replaces an entire document, only fields included in the second parameter will be present in the document after the operation executes.

In addition to the syntax we’ve learned throughout this lesson, MongoDB offers us other syntax and commands that can be useful when deleting or replacing documents:
- The .findOneAndReplace() method is very similar to .replaceOne(). It replaces a document in a collection based on filter criteria, but instead of returning a document that acknowledges the operation, it returns either the original document or the replacement document.
- The .findOneAndDelete() method deletes a document, and returns the deleted document.
