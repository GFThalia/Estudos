### NoSQL
- NoSQL stands for “not-only SQL” (also called “non-relational”, or “non-SQL”) and refers to any database that stores data in any format other than relational tables.
- NoSQL database technology grew in popularity due to datasets growing in size and complexity.
- NoSQL databases may provide flexibility, scalability, and speed advantages.
- NoSQL databases experience disadvantages such as lack of data integrity and lack of language standardization across different NoSQL databases.
- Common types of NoSQL databases include key-value, document, graph, and column-oriented.

#### MongoDB
- MongoDB is a NoSQL document database. This means that data entries in the database are stored inside documents within collections.
- Choosing to use MongoDB has some key benefits:
- Flexibility and Scalability
- Developer Friendly
- Diverse Cloud Tooling
- A MongoDB instance can contain many databases, and within a database are collections of similar data. Collections contain individual records called documents that are stored as field-value pairs.
- JSON is a human-readable but inefficient format for storing data; conversely, BSON is not human-readable but is highly efficient.
- MongoDB users can easily store and manipulate data as JSON – even though internally, that data is stored as BSON.
