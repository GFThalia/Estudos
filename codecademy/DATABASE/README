### Databases
- Databases are systems that store, modify, and access structured collections of information electronically.
- Database Management Systems (DBMS) allow developers to communicate via code or a graphical user interface with a database.
- Databases can store a wide range of data types, including text, numbers, dates and times, and files of various types.
#### Relational Databases
- Relational databases, a common database class, organize data into tables of rows and columns of information and rely on relationships to organize data.
- A relational database schema is typically pre-defined before data is entered.
- All relational databases use SQL to allow developers to communicate with the database using a common language.
- Relational databases can be costly to set up and scale. Performance and cost are big factors in using a relational database in an application.
#### Non-Relational Databases
- Non-relational databases, another common database class, refer to any database that does not follow the relational model.
- Non-relational databases typically have a more flexible schema and are more easily scaled than relational databases. However, the unstructured nature of the data can make it difficult to maintain, and each non-relational database has its own query language.
